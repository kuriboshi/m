M: A minimal build generator

'M' is a build generator for simple C or C++ programs which depends on
a simple external libraries.  The external libraries can be downloaded
automatically and, if they are simple enough, built.  'M' uses 'ninja'
as the backend.

At the moment 'm' is a proof of concept and can only handle fairly
simple projects.  It's written in ksh which means that any ksh
statement can be used in the build config files.  However, don't
expect this to always be the case.

A project can contain one or more config files named '_m'.  There has
to be at least one '_m' file in the top directory.

See the '_m' file in this directory for a sample config file.
