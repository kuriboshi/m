M: A minimal build generator

Copyright 2018 Krister Joas <krister@joas.jp>

'M' is a build generator for simple C or C++ programs which depends on
simple external libraries.  The external libraries can be downloaded
automatically and, if they are simple enough, built.  'M' uses 'ninja'
as the backend.

The 'm' file is a proof of concept and can only handle fairly simple
projects.  It's written in ksh which means that any ksh statement can
be used in the build config files.  However, don't expect this to
always be the case.

A project can contain one or more config files named '_m'.  There has
to be at least one '_m' file in the top directory.

See the '_m' file in this directory for a sample config file.
