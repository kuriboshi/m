M: A minimal build generator

Copyright 2018 Krister Joas <krister@joas.jp>

The C++ version of 'm'.  Only tested on macOS version 10.13.  Requires
a C++-14 compiler and Boost (only filesystem and process).  Tested
with Boost 1.67.0.  It's mostly compatible with the ksh version of
'm'.  The order of options and libraries may differ because the C++
version is more careful keeping the order items were added in the _m
file.

To build, either use the ksh version of 'm' to build or bootstrap by
running make in m/src.  The latter will build 'm' in the 'bootstrap'
directory.

As with 'ksh m' it depends on ninja as a backend.  Downloading
external libraries requires git (Mercurial is not supported at the
moment).
